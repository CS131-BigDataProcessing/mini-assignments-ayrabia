To remove spaces, I used sed to search and avoid unnecessary white spaces
For missing values, I replaced them with NA to obtain a clearer vision of the data set.
For duplicate entries, I used sort -u to ensure there are none.
To ensure no outliers, I capped the values at 1000 to avoid any extreme values.
